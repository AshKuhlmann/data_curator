Stop letting downloads, documents, and project folders descend into chaos. Review, decide, and act with an intuitive interface.A preview of the Data Curator interface in action.The ProblemWe all have them: the "Downloads" folder filled with files from months ago, the "Desktop" littered with temporary screenshots, the "Projects" directory with old assets. Sifting through this digital clutter is tedious. Data Curator turns this chore into a quick and even satisfying process.Key FeaturesVisual File Curation: Select a folder (your "repository") and Data Curator presents you with one file at a time, so you can focus and make decisions without being overwhelmed.Intelligent Scanning: The app cleverly remembers which files you've already curated, so you only review new or previously postponed items.Powerful Actions: For each file, you can:Keep (Forever): Mark the file as important and permanent.Keep (Temporary): Keep the file for a configurable period (e.g., 90 days). The app will notify you when it expires!Rename: Quickly give the file a more meaningful name.Open Location: Instantly open the file's containing folder in your system's file explorer.Decide Later: Skip the file for now. It will be presented to you again in a future session.Delete: Securely and permanently delete the file after a confirmation.Rich File Previews: No need to open every file to know what it is. Data Curator features a large preview pane with support for:Images: png, jpg, gif, bmp, etc.Text Files: txt, md, log, etc.PDF Documents: View PDFs directly within the app.Tabular Data: Renders .csv files in a clean, readable table.Source Code: Displays code with syntax highlighting for dozens of languages.Undo Your Last Action: Accidentally deleted a file? No problem. A simple undo feature lets you reverse your last decision.Expiry Notifications: On startup, the app checks for any temporarily kept files whose time is up and asks you what you'd like to do with them.Persistent State: All your decisions are saved locally in a simple json file, giving you a complete record of your curation activities.Cross-Platform: Built with Python and its standard libraries, Data Curator runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.InstallationYou can get Data Curator up and running in two ways:1.
