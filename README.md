# Data Curator

Data Curator is a visual tool for cleaning up your folders one file at a time. It remembers what you have already reviewed and supports common file types such as images, text, PDF documents and more. Files can be kept permanently, kept temporarily with an expiry date, renamed, opened in your file browser, skipped for later or deleted. The state of your decisions is saved locally so you can resume where you left off.

## Key Features

- **Visual file curation**: Review items individually with a large preview pane.
- **Intelligent scanning**: Previously curated files are skipped so you only see new or postponed items.
- **Rich previews**: Supports images, text files, PDFs, CSV tables and syntax highlighted code.
- **Powerful actions**: Keep forever, keep temporarily, rename, open location, decide later or delete.
- **Undo support**: Reverse your last action if you make a mistake.
- **Expiry notifications**: The app notifies you when temporary files expire.
- **Cross platform**: Works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Building an Executable

To generate a standalone executable with PyInstaller:

1. Add PyInstaller as a development dependency:

```bash
poetry add pyinstaller --group dev
```

2. Run the packaging command from the project root:

```bash
poetry run pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name DataCurator data_curator_app/main.py
```

- `--onefile` creates a single executable file.
- `--windowed` prevents a console window from appearing.
- `--name DataCurator` sets the name of the final executable.
- `data_curator_app/main.py` is the entry point of the application.

The resulting file will be located in the `dist` folder and can be shared with others.
